# Git = Version Control 

What it means in simple language? 

1. It allows you to keep a track of all the changes you made to a file. ( #commits )  
2. It allows you to share your code with 
    others. 
    *( Imagine having to share your code in pre-git times )
3. It allows you to collaborate with others on the same file. 
    Imagine 25 developers making changes to the same file. 

# Above 3 are the major pain points solved by Git. 

# Repository 
- Repository is the central idea behind Git 
- It's a data structure which holds our codes and the changes 
- Different operations are performed on repository e.g.
1. Creation
2. Modification / Changes 
3. Cloning etc. 

- Repository keeps a track of what changes are made to the files being tracked. 


Note: Git / Github are not limited to use in context of softwares only. They are a general idea which can be applied to other domains like design. 


### 
# Github = Platform which provides services around Git. 

In Simple Language: Github is a website which makes using git even easier. 

1. It allows you to create git repositories
    in the cloud ( so you can access them anywhere ) 

2. It provides you with tools / storage etc 
    required to maintain your remote repositories. 

3. It allows you setup access ( who can access your code ) 

4. It keeps on evolving everyday ( e.g. Github Actions / Organisations etc. )
